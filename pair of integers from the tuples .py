"""
for i in 10,20,30:
    print("hello")
"""

# This code will print "hello" three times, once for each value in the tuple (10, 20, 30).
# It is a simple loop that iterates over a tuple containing three integers.
# The output will be:hello 3 times 

# problem 2 : data should be in single bundle 
for i,j in(20,10),(30,50):
    print(i+j)
# This code will print the sum of each pair of integers from the tuples (20, 10) and (30, 50).
# The output will be:
# 30 (20 + 10)
# 80 (30 + 50)
