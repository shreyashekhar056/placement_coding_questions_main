# This code initializes a variable `a` to 10, then iterates through even numbers from 10 to 18,
# adding 3 to `a` for each iteration. After the loop, it adds 2 to `a` and prints the final value.
# The loop runs 5 times, so `a` will be incremented by 15 (3 * 5) and then by 2, resulting in a final value of 27
